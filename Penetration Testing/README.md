# **Penetration Testing Repository**  

## **1. Overview**  
Penetration testing (Pentesting) is the practice of simulating cyberattacks to identify security vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource hub for penetration testers, covering methodologies, tools, and techniques for assessing security across networks, applications, and infrastructure.  

## **2. Topics Covered**  
✅ **Pentesting Methodologies** (PTES, OSSTMM, NIST, MITRE ATT&CK)  
✅ **Web Application Security** (OWASP Top 10, API Security, SSRF, IDOR)  
✅ **Network Penetration Testing** (Reconnaissance, Exploitation, Lateral Movement)  
✅ **Wireless & IoT Security** (Wi-Fi Hacking, BLE Exploitation, Hardware Hacking)  
✅ **Privilege Escalation & Post-Exploitation** (Windows, Linux, Active Directory)  
✅ **Social Engineering & Phishing** (OSINT, Spear Phishing, Human Exploitation)  
✅ **Red Teaming & Adversary Simulation**  

## **3. Tools & Frameworks**  
🔹 **Reconnaissance:** Amass, Sublist3r, Shodan, Maltego
