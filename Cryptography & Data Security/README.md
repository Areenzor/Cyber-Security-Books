# **🔐 Cryptography & Data Security**  

## **Overview**  
Cryptography and data security are essential for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and cyber threats. This repository explores encryption techniques, hashing, digital signatures, and secure data storage practices.  

## **Topics Covered**  
✅ Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption (AES, RSA, ECC)  
✅ Hashing Algorithms (SHA-256, MD5, BLAKE2)  
✅ Digital Signatures & Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  
✅ Secure Communication Protocols (SSL/TLS, PGP)  
✅ Data Protection & Secure Storage Techniques  

## **Why Cryptography Matters?**  
🔹 Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data  
🔹 Prevents unauthorized access and data breaches  
🔹 Forms the backbone of secure communication and transactions  

🔧 **Tools & Technologies:**  
- OpenSSL, GnuPG, Hashcat  
- PGP Encryption, TLS/SSL Certificates  
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
